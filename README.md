Currently learning Zig ⚡

📚 **Books**

* **Currently Reading**: **Writing an Interpreter in Go** - You will learn how to build a lexer, a parser and an interpreter, you'll build a Pratt's parser, which is one kind of top-down operator precedence parser.
* **Recommended Read**:
  - Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Understand most of the things that you need to know to work nowadays.
  - Database Internals - Understand how database internals works, strategies that storage systems uses, some things about consensus and distributed-systems. 
  - Go in Action - Golang reference.
  - 100 Go Mistakes - If you already know some Go, this is the best book that I know.
  - Kubernetes in Action - Is the only Kubernetes book that I've read, so I cannot compare too much, but it worked for me.
* **List for the future**:
  - The art of PostgreSQL - I've been working mostly with NoSQL databases, specially KV and Column-Based storages, so I think that I need to take out the Rust on SQL.
  - Understanding Distributed-Systems - Although I've studied a lot about distributed systems, there are a lot of recommendations about this book, so I'll try.
